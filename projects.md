    classes and macros.  Examples include cheat sheets, school 
    assignments, a technical resume and cover letter, and a 
    Latin-English dictionary.

    <span class="image fit"><img src="assets/images/Sun-Guard-Thumb.png" alt="The Sun Guard project poster" /></span>
		<h3>Engineering Design Project: Making BC's Ski Slopes Safer</h3>
		<p>I led a team that designed a component to be added to ski lift 
    sheave assemblies to mitigate the occurrence of unretained deropements.  
    The design presented won the design competition presided over by the 
    BC Safety Authority in which over 100 teams competed.

    <span class="image fit"><img src="assets/images/robot_thumb.jpg" alt="an autonomous robot" /></span>
		<h3>Engineering Design Competition: Autonomous Robotics</h3>
		<p>Our team designed, assembled, and programmed an autonomous 
    robot using a VEX Robotics kit that accomplished tasks simulating 
    the disposal of hazardous materials.  I served as lead programmer, 
    co-designer and co-constructor on the robotics project.</p>

    <span class="image fit"><img src="assets/images/oakplay.jpg" alt="an example of the OakPlay interface" /></span>
		<h3>Software Architecture Project: <strong>OakPlay</strong></h3>
		<p>The development team was tasked with authoring a web app with 
    functionality to schedule facility bookings for a recreation 
    centre. The team designed and implemented a fully featured 
    system with an innovative grid selection page for scheduling.

    <span class="image fit"><img src="assets/images/kts2.png" alt="the KTS project webpage" /></span>
		<h3>Requirements Engineering Project: <strong>Killer Tech Solutions</strong></h3>
		<p>The team consulted with a local tech business to learn 
    about requirements engineering techniques that are successful 
    in real-world applications.  Furthermore, the team collected 
    requirements and authored documents on requirements and 
    design which were published on a bespoke project website.

		<h3>UVic Formula SAE Motorsports Team: Software Project Lead</h3>
		<p>Created the initial design of the current website using 
    HTML5 templates.  The design was based on requirements 
    elicited from team leadership.  I also led a requirements
    elicitation effort with regards to a
    development project for a new website/knowledgebase 
    application, to be developed in elixir, which was ultimately
    scrapped owing to resource constraints.

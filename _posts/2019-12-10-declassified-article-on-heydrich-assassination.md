# Good Reads: A Declassified CIA Article #

Declassified in 1993, and written in 1960, this 
[article][1], taken from CIA periodical 
*Studies in Intelligence,* recounts in gripping detail
the preparations, execution, aftermath, and the subsequent
descent into (temporary) obscurity of the Reinhard Heydrich
assassination carried out in 1942 during WWII.

While the story is possibly somewhat dramatised, and is
also wrought with errors, particularly regarding the dates
surrounding specific events of the operation, its lacking
credibility is made up for by its straight-forward style
and for being an attempt at an omnipotent narrative of a
truly epic and harrowing episode in recent history.

Worth the read, the article is not long and will at the
very least amuse intelligence buffs and historians alike.
It is thus the first of hopefully many **good reads** to 
come.

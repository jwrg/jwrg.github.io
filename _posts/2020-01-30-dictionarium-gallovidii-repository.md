As [Capiar][capiar] starts to evolve into an actually useful
collection of LaTeX classes and macro packages, it feels
like the right time to clean up the project tree somewhat
by giving the Dictionarium Gallovidii, a Latin-English
dictionary which heavily leverages Capiar and serves as
a reference as I learn the Latin language, its own
[repository][dictionarium] and development blog.

Owing to the increasing size of the dictionary, it is
prudent to start thinking of it as a standalone project
in its own right.  To reflect the role played by the
class and macro package in authoring the document, the
*linguistics* class and package will be renamed
*dictionarium*.  This won't be confusing at all because
I just said so.  Expect other class and package names from
Capiar to change depending on name conflicts on CTAN.

Considering how utterly useful this reference document has
been as a learning aid for Latin, I am starting a skeleton
project based on Dictionarium to aid my efforts in learning
the Japanese language, tentatively called *Jisho*.  Don't
expect much work to be done on this new document until
the Latin work starts to wrap up.

The next steps for *Dictionarium*, such as completing the
content entry from primary sources and the identification
of secondary sources and stylistic cues, will be found soon
on the *Dictionarium*'s development blog (once I figure
that out, anyway).

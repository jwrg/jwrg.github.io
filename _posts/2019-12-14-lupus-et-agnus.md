This is my first translation post, not a particularly
lofty effort, but hopefully one amusing enough.  Find below
the well-known Fable by Aesop, adapted into Latin by
Phaedrus, *Lupus et Agnus*, or in English, *The Wolf and 
the Lamb.* 

| Latin | English |
| --- | --- |
| Ad r&imacr;vum eundem lupus et &amacr;gnus v&emacr;nerant, | Driven by thirst, the wolf and lamb came to |
| sit&imacr; compuls&imacr;. Superior st&amacr;bat lupus, | the same river.  Upriver stood the wolf, and some distance |
| long&emacr;que &imacr;nferior &amacr;gnus.  Tunc fauce improb&amacr; | away, downriver stood the lamb.  By his wicked tongue, |
| latr&omacr; incit&amacr;tus i&umacr;rgi&imacr; causam intulit; | the provocative brigand brought forth cause for quarrel; |
| "Cur" inquit "turbulentam f&emacr;cist&imacr; mihi | "Why," he asks "have you so muddied my |
| aquam bibent&imacr;?"  L&amacr;niger, contr&amacr; tim&emacr;ns | drinking water?"  Fearfully, the wollen one countered |
| "Qu&imacr; possum, quaes&omacr;, facere quod quereris, lupe? | "How can I, pray tell, cause that which you lament, wolf? |
| &Amacr; t&emacr; d&emacr;currit ad me&omacr;s haust&umacr;s liquor." | The water flows past you to where I am drinking." |
| Repulsus ille v&emacr;rit&amacr;tis v&imacr;ribus | Taken aback by the force of the facts, the wolf declared: |
| "Ante h&omacr;s sex m&emacr;ns&emacr;s male" ait "d&imacr;xist&imacr; mihi." | "Six months ago, you spoke ill of me." |
| Respondit &amacr;gnus "Equidem n&amacr;tus n&omacr;n eram." | "Indeed," the lamb responded, "I had not yet been born." |
| "Pater hercle tuus" ille inquit "maled&imacr;xit mihi;" | "By Jove, your father, then," searched the wolf "spoke ill of me;" |
| atque ita correptum lacerat ini&umacr;st&amacr; nece. | and thus the lamb was seized, torn asunder, unjustly slaugtered. |
| Haec propter ill&omacr;s scr&imacr;pta est homin&emacr;s f&amacr;bula | This fable was penned to address those men |
| qu&imacr; f&imacr;ct&imacr;s caus&imacr;s innocent&emacr;s opprimunt. | who by fallacious justification tread upon the innocent. |

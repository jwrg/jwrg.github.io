This is my first translation post, not a particularly
lofty effort, but hopefully one amusing enough.  Find below
the well-known Fable by Aesop, adapted into Latin by
Phaedrus, *Lupus et Agnus*, or in English, *The Wolf and 
the Lamb.* 

| Latin | English |

| Ad r&#299;vum eundem lupus et &#257;gnus v&#275;nerant, | Driven by thirst, the wolf and lamb came to |
| sit&#299; compuls&#299;. Superior st&#257;bat lupus, | the same river.  Upriver stood the wolf, and some distance |
| long&#275;que &#299;nferior &#257;gnus.  Tunc fauce improb&#257; | away, downriver stood the lamb.  By his wicked tongue, |
| latr&#333; incit&#257;tus i&#363;rgi&#299; causam intulit; | the provocative brigand brought forth cause for quarrel; |
| "Cur" inquit "turbulentam f&#275;cist&#299; mihi | "Why," he asks "have you so muddied my |
| aquam bibent&#299;?"  L&#257;niger, contr&#257; tim&#275;ns | drinking water?"  Fearfully, the woolen one countered |
| "Qu&#299; possum, quaes&#333;, facere quod quereris, lupe? | "How can I, pray tell, cause that which you lament, wolf? |
| &#256; t&#275; d&#275;currit ad me&#333;s haust&#363;s liquor." | The water flows past you to where I am drinking." |
| Repulsus ille v&#275;rit&#257;tis v&#299;ribus | Taken aback by the force of the facts, the wolf declared: |
| "Ante h&#333;s sex m&#275;ns&#275;s male" ait "d&#299;xist&#299; mihi." | "Six months ago, you spoke ill of me." |
| Respondit &#257;gnus "Equidem n&#257;tus n&#333;n eram." | "Indeed," the lamb responded, "I had not yet been born." |
| "Pater hercle tuus" ille inquit "maled&#299;xit mihi;" | "By Jove, your father, then," searched the wolf "spoke ill of me;" |
| atque ita correptum lacerat ini&#363;st&#257; nece. | and thus the lamb was seized, torn asunder, unjustly slaughtered. |
| Haec propter ill&#333;s scr&#299;pta est homin&#275;s f&#257;bula | This fable was penned to address those men |
| qu&#299; f&#299;ct&#299;s caus&#299;s innocent&#275;s opprimunt. | who by fallacious justification tread upon the innocent. |

					<h3>Experience</h3>
				</header>
				<p>I have worked in both cyber risk consulting and systems engineering,
        in both cases entrusted with sensitive materials and high-value, 
        high-tech systems.</p>
				<p>I have a number of interesting projects both in maintenance and
        development, which are outlined on the projects page.</p>

					<h3>Personal interests</h3>
				</header>
				<p>I am a big sports fan, particularly hockey and football, and
        having grown up around Pacific Northwest rainforests, am passionate
        about the great outdoors and conservation of said.
        </p>
        <p>My expertise in linguistics and broad smattering of language
        knowledge is rooted in my esteem for the classics, particularly
        Ancient Greek and Roman literature.  I hope to produce a decent
        volume of translation snippets for the blog.

			<h2>The Code</h2>
		</header>
		<p>I've talked myself up as quite a jack-of-all-trades (which I
    am, mind you), but ultimately, I am at the core a software
    engineer (emphasis on engineer, my degree does not say computer
    science on it).  One's writings (code) should speak for oneself.
    </p>
    <p> So, if you would like to simply jump right into the code I have made
    public, please check out my GitHub projects directly:</p>
